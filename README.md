# Nash Equilibrium in a Duopoly
# set following parameters in the "main" function:
# cost_price1: cost price of shop1
# cost_price2: cost price of shop2
# market_demand: market demand with 0 average price (positive)
# market_coeff: the coefficient of average price (non-positive)
# price_coeff1: the coefficient of selling price of shop1 in the demand equation of shop1. (negative)
# intercept1: demand of shop1 with zero selling price of shop1 and shop2. 
# comp_coeff1: the coefficient of selling price of shop2 in the demand equation of shop1. (positive)
# iterations: number of iterations the algorithm would run for
